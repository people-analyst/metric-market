# Replit Handoff Documents — Index and How to Use

**Purpose**: Paste-ready handoff documents for each Replit application. Each handoff references **GitHub folders and files** in the meta-factory repo and gives **instructions** for that application. You can paste the handoff into the respective Replit project so the team (or an agent) there has clear context.

**Meta-factory repo**: https://github.com/people-analyst/meta-factory  

**Default branch**: `main`. All paths below are relative to repo root; full URLs: `https://github.com/people-analyst/meta-factory/tree/main/<path>` (folders) or `https://github.com/people-analyst/meta-factory/blob/main/<path>` (files).

**Single cut-and-paste document**: For one file you can open and copy from (each app’s instructions + reference locations in plain text, no links to open), use **[PASTE_INTO_EACH_APP.md](PASTE_INTO_EACH_APP.md)**. Copy the section for each Replit app and paste it into that project (e.g. as `HANDOFF_FROM_META_FACTORY.md` or into the project README).

**BigQuery / data pipeline context**: For compensation and market-data apps (AnyComp, Conductor, Market Data Backend, etc.), use **[DATA_PIPELINE_CONTEXT_BY_APP.md](DATA_PIPELINE_CONTEXT_BY_APP.md)**. Copy the section for each app — it describes the BigQuery pipeline (`pa-market-data-2026`), what data exists, and what that app owns or consumes. See also **[../COMPENSATION_MIGRATION_STATUS_AND_OWNERSHIP.md](../COMPENSATION_MIGRATION_STATUS_AND_OWNERSHIP.md)** for overall status and ownership.

**Questions for Replit agents**: To gather answers from each app (blockers, dependencies, timelines), use **[QUESTIONS_FOR_REPLIT_AGENTS.md](QUESTIONS_FOR_REPLIT_AGENTS.md)**. Relay the questions, capture answers, and bring them back to update status.

**Share externally (no repo access)**: For people outside Cursor who may not have access to this repo, use the **[compensation-migration-bundle/](compensation-migration-bundle/)** folder. It contains self-contained docs you can email, post to Drive, or zip and share. See [compensation-migration-bundle/README.md](compensation-migration-bundle/README.md) for sharing options.

## Shared instructions (for every Replit app)

**You can paste the block below into each Replit project** (e.g. in a `HANDOFF_FROM_META_FACTORY.md` or in the project README). It applies to all handoffs. Each app-specific handoff (table above) adds GitHub paths and app-focused instructions.

---

### Instructions from Meta-Factory

1. **Review the intentions** described in the handoff and in the linked meta-factory documentation. Understand the product and technical goals that were set in meta-factory for this capability.

2. **Review the documentation** at the GitHub paths listed in your handoff. Use it to expand your vision or to do what you do better—adopt requirements, specs, and constraints that still apply.

3. **Review the code** at the GitHub folder paths listed. Identify what is **useful** to you: types, utilities, algorithms, or integration patterns. Adopt or port what improves this Replit project; ignore what does not apply.

4. **Align to a single codebase** in this Replit project. Do not maintain a fork of meta-factory inside this app. Bring the useful pieces into this repo, refactor to your stack and standards, and own the code here. We are aiming for the **highest quality standard** in this environment.

5. **Prove it in Replit**. Once this project has absorbed the relevant functionality, documents, and metadata and is running at the desired quality, meta-factory will **dissolve** (remove) that code and those packages from its side for cleanup. Your environment becomes the source of truth for this application.

6. **Shared metadata**: Some reference data (e.g. job structures, canonical segmentation, level codes) may have a **shared need**—meta-factory classifies written materials to jobs; Replit apps use the same structures for HRIS and compensation. We may retain a **single source of truth** for that metadata, with **reconciliation** and **pass-through APIs** so both sides stay aligned. Your handoff will note if your app consumes or contributes to such shared metadata.

## Note for the migration agent (meta-factory side)

**Goal**: Confirm that **all functionality, documents, metadata, and code** that belong in the Replit (or other target) applications have been **migrated where they should go**. Then make decisions about **what on the meta-factory side is now obsolete** and can be **removed for cleanup**.  

The handoffs and the [Splinter Exit Plan](../SPLINTER_EXIT_PLAN.md) define the clusters and the end state (no splinter application code left in meta-factory; only agreed shared metadata may remain or be shared via APIs). Use the per-app handoffs to verify migration completeness, then proceed with removal and cleanup in meta-factory.
