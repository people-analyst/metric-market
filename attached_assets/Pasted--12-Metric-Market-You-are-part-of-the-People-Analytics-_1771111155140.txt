## 12. Metric Market

```
You are part of the People Analytics Toolbox ecosystem — a hub-and-spoke platform with 12 specialized applications. As the data visualization and dashboard layer, you are the primary consumer-facing display for the entire ecosystem's outputs.

First, read the ecosystem context package:
curl -s https://682eb7bd-f279-41bd-ac9e-1ad52cd23036-00-sc7pg47dpokt.spock.replit.dev/api/workbench/context-package

Here are the 11 other applications:

| App | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| Conductor | Data model exploration, orchestration, cross-system integration |
| Segmentation Studio | HRIS normalization, canonical field mapping, dimension building |
| Data Anonymizer | PII detection, masking, tokenization, synthetic data generation |
| PeopleAnalyst | Executive forecasting, Monte Carlo simulation, VOI analysis |
| Metric Engine Calculus | Metric computation, statistical enrichment, trend analysis |
| Preference Modeler | Survey response collection and preference modeling |
| Reincarnation | Adaptive diagnostics, survey item management, psychometric optimization |
| AnyComp | Compensation decision support, scenario optimization |
| VOI Calculator | Value of Investment quantification for analytics initiatives |
| Decision Wizard | Structured decision-making frameworks |
| Product Kanban | Development tracking across the ecosystem |

As the ecosystem's visualization layer, you should be the place where outputs from every other app become visible. Consider:
- Metric Engine Calculus computes HR metrics with trend analysis — could it push computed results directly to your card bundle API?
- PeopleAnalyst produces probability forecasts and Monte Carlo results — could those become specialized forecast visualization cards?
- AnyComp's compensation scenarios could appear as interactive comp strategy dashboards
- Segmentation Studio's population dimensions could power segment-filtered views across all your cards
- VOI Calculator's ROI analyses could render as investment return cards
- Product Kanban's velocity and burndown data could populate an ecosystem health dashboard

Please develop:
1. A list of 3-4 specific integrations where other apps push data to your card system
2. For each integration, define the data contract — what format, fields, and refresh frequency you need FROM that app
3. What you could OFFER to that app (embeddable cards, dashboard links, data visualization as a service)
4. A rough development plan with priorities

Also: Your documentation score is 63/100. As part of this planning exercise, please refresh your hub-docs.md to cover all 9 required documentation sections (Application Overview, Technology Stack, Platform Ecosystem Context, Features & Pages, Complete API Reference, Database Schema, Data Contracts & Export Formats, Current Instance Data Summary, System Health & Recommendations). Each section needs 50+ words, structured lists, and code snippets. Push the updated documentation to the hub when done.

Write your integration plan to hub-docs.md under a new section "## Ecosystem Integration Plan" and push everything to the hub.
